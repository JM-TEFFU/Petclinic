## 🚀 Let’s Put Everything Together! Clone and Deploy the PetClinic Application! 🐾


Hey everyone!


Let us put altogether what we have learned so far! In my previous posts, I showed you how to install Maven and set up Tomcat, as well as how to build applications with Spring Boot. Now, it’s time to apply that knowledge with the PetClinic application!


# 📦 What You Need:

1. Maven: Make sure it’s installed.

2. Tomcat Server: Have it running on your computer.


# 📥 Clone or Fork the Repository:


You can find the PetClinic application on GitHub. Clone or fork it using this link: https://github.com/JM-TEFFU/Petclinic.git


# 🛠️ Steps to Get Started:


Step 1: Clone the Repository: Open your terminal and run:


`$ git clone https://github.com/JM-TEFFU/Petclinic.git`



Step 2: Go to the Project Folder:


`$ cd Petclinic`


Step 3: Delete any previous built files


`$ mvn clean`


Step 4: Build the Project with Maven: Run this command to build it:


`$ mvn clean package`


Step 5: Deploy to Tomcat: Copy the generated .war file from the target folder to the webapps folder in your Tomcat directory.


Step 6:  Start Tomcat: If Tomcat isn’t running, start it up. You can access the app by going to:


http://127.0.0.1:8080/petclinic


🌟 Explore and Enjoy!


Dive into the application, make changes, and see how everything works together. This is a fantastic opportunity to practice what you’ve learned!

Let me know how it goes or if you have any questions. Happy coding! 💻✨
